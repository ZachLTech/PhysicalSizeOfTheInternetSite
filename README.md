# PhysicalSizeOfTheInternetSite

Welcome to the PhysicalSizeOfTheInternetSite repository! Explore the intricacies of the internet's physical size with real-time updates on [internetsize.site](https://internetsize.site).

## Purpose

### Idea Origin
Have you ever wondered about the physical size of the internet? This project originated from a simple, yet intriguing, thought during a moment of boredom. Picture this: pondering with friends about the possibility of downloading the entire internet onto local drives. A few Google searches, some mathematical calculations, and a spark of curiosity later, the idea evolved into a fully automated website. Now, it's here for anyone else who might be crazy enough to ask, "How big is the internetâ€”physically?". I also mention this on the [disclaimer page](https://internetsize.site/Why/Index.html)

### Main Challenge
Although it started as me simply thinking "oh how big is the internet physically" and me punching in numbers to a calculator, once I started to actually look at the calculations for the size physically, it just didn't make sense. This along with the fact that I wanted to make the calculations dynamic to variables such as how many storage mediums are stacked and lined up made me realize how complex the math would actually be.

So aside from learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I was mainly stumped for a while on this project figuring out how I want to calculate everything until, after being the thinker for a little bit (lol), I finally formulated a math formula that would adapt the width and length of this hypothetical datacenter storing the internet based on the amount of layers or devices you want to stack. This was very important to keep the same amount of devices when calculating the new width and height all the while making this width and height follow the golden ratio for optimum hypothetical datacenter shape ðŸ˜„. I outline this main math portion and how it's all calculated on the [calculations page](https://internetsize.site/TheMath/index.html)

## Features

- Real-time updates: Witness the dynamic changes in the physical size of the internet as well as the price it takes to store the entire internet.
- Multiple Storage Statistics: View internet sizes not only stored in boring old hard drives, but also explore the outlandish idea of storing the internet anywhere from M.2 SSD's to Floppy disks!
- Adjustable units and values: from Terabytes to kilobytes, Miles to inches, Thousands of stacked devices to tens, almost every unit is adjustable to answer all of your curiosities as well as the amount of devices you stack to make a realistic datacenter.
- Golden Ratio Integration: Making sure not to have a hypothetical datacenter that would be a boring old square, Each value is calculated to follow the notorious [golden ratio](https://www.britannica.com/science/golden-ratio) which is detailed in the [calculations page](https://internetsize.site/TheMath/index.html)
- Detailed help page: Finding yourself confused won't be a problem with the [help page](https://internetsize.site/Help/Index.html) showing and explaining every option, button, and feature present across all storage device pages 
- Unique navigation: Fancy drag-to-move parallax carousel menu to navigate through pages
- Homemade Vanilla JS Animations: All animations and moving parts are made purely with vanilla javascript and css excluding the main navigation page which utilizes [gsap](https://gsap.com/)
- Visually enjoyable pages: each page is packed with either fancy and unique navigation or colors specific to that page
- Self-taught journey: This project serves as a testament to the developer's journey into web development. As a beginner with limited JavaScript skills, the site was crafted using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Learning from the best: Drawing inspiration from CodePen, the design elements reflect the learning process, showcasing creative implementations discovered while exploring CSS.
- Easter eggs: Even hidden features you might find in this site!! Hint: >! You may find a button that runs away as you click it... 

**Sadly though, this isn't mobile friendly and you'll get a sad message explaining this if you were to open the website's navigation on mobile**
