## Purpose

Why am I doing this?: 
 Well the somewhat basic thought came into my mind one day while bored and thinking outloud with a few friends what it would be like if someone were able to download the entire internet on only local drives, so I did a few google searches and some math to find out a very inaccurate and estimated size of the internet. Then... it hit me- What if I automated this task and turned it into a website for other curious people that for some crazy reason might think to themselves... "I wonder how big the internet really is (physically)"
