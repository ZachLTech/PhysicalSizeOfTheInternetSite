# PhysicalSizeOfTheInternetSite

In this repository I plan to simply make a website that takes the current size of the entire internet and calculates how big that would be physically if it were to all be downloaded on hardware such as an SSD or MicroSD :)


Why am I doing this?: 
 Well the somewhat basic thought came into my mind one day while bored and thinking outloud with a few friends what it would be like if someone were able to download the entire internet on only local drives, so I did a few google searches and some math to find out a very inaccurate and estimated size of the internet. Then... it hit me- What if I automated this task and turned it into a website for other curious people that for some crazy reason might think to themselves... "I wonder how big the internet really is (physically)" 


If you're wondering where the code in progress is for this repository:

 it isn't quite public yet. Once I get a basic working script to do this, I'll start uploading it for others to help and try it themselves if they want. But at the moment this mini project isn't really a priority to me so I'll only be working on it in my free time. Also I might run into some issues finding the exact size of the internet storage wise lol but who knows.
