## Fix
- purple streak follow cursor
- sizes of fonts and placement
- make width work and not be 0
- make width and length actually update and change based on time and input/ find a way to overrite a function interval if something else is happening (TRY PUTTING THE INTERVAL INTO AN IF STATEMENT)

## Add
- HTML  title and pic
- fake copyright funny like last time at bottom
- disclaimer saying its not fully accurate 
- CSS for input box

## Test
- make sure input box is working
- use if statment in check function to do smth with stackheight so it updates down when input change down
